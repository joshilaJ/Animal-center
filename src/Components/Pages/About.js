        Austin Animal Center is the municipal shelter for the City of Austin and unincorporated Travis County, providing shelter to thousands of animals annually as well as providing animal protection and pet resource services. We accept stray and owned animals regardless of age, health, species or breed.

Our goal is to place all adoptable animals in forever homes through adoption, foster care, or rescue partner groups.

Animal Services has numerous programs and partnerships designed to help pets in the shelter, in the community, and in your home.
